# :zap: vim-ckb :zap:

**A whole new level of editor immersion is here!**
**Never before has a developer been able to achieve such code zen!**

vim-ckb is a hacky little 50-line plugin I made to put nice colors on my keyboard. I mainly made it to learn a little bit more about vimscript, and it's an incredibly simple plugin, but it may be the missing piece in your development environment that will boost your productivity and make your kitchen sparkle like new.

# Usage

This plugin depends on [ckb-daemon](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next). It's completely untested on MacOS, and barely tested on Linux, so it may not work perfectly :P

Once ckb-daemon is up and running, just install this plugin with your favorite plugin manager and have fun!
